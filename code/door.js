/**
 * A Door has an animation which gradually plays as the Door is opened
 * by dragging a pointer a distance specified by openDist.
 *
 * Door.opened can be queried to determine if the door is entirely open.
 * The Door can be set to start locked, which prevents the animation from
 * proceeding and prevents the Door reaching the opened state.
 *
 * @param {array} textures --- Textures of the animation in order.
 * @param {number} openDist --- How far pointer dragged to completely open door.
 *                              Animation is interpolated.
 * @param {boolean} [locked=false] --- Whether door starts locked.
